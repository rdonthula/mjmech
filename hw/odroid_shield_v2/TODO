r1 defects
  * JD connectors on bottom have incorrect part number
  * Master fuse pads are on top of board instead of bottom
  * It would be nice to have silks for the odroid IO connector so that
    I can remember which is which for bringup and test
  * shore power connector seems to have the switch pin connected up as
    ground rather than the ground pin
  * would be nice to have sensing for 5V, 1.8V, and battery rail
    voltage
  * silk screen for top facing JST XH connectors is backwards
  * weapon connector would be better placed in opening further from
    center so that it is not under the turret when rotated


 * update all part numbers based on macrofab run

 * odroid shield for mech
   * accessible from top
     * 2x4 0.1" header for aeg/agitator/laser
     * USB for camera
     * master power switch
     * weapon power switch
     * blinking weapon power light
     * 5V power light
     * shore power connector
     * 12V power for gimbal
     * data for gimbal
     * I2C connector
   * power distribution
     * input connector/pins for battery
     * high current fuse
     * shore power connector for odroid
       * DPN: CP-034A-ND
   * 5V buck regulator for odroid
     * ST1S10  DPN: 497-6904-1-ND
   * 12V boost for gimbal controller
     * MIC2253 DPN: 576-3643-6-ND
   * servo power/data connectors for legs
   * AEG motor driver - MC33926
   * agitator motor driver - MC33926
   * laser control - FET
   * I2C level shift
   * Serial level shift
   * AVR - on I2C bus (or probably serial like we have now)
   * switches
      * CKN5001-ND
      * power
      * weapon
   * power light
   * weapon light
   * some connection for scoring transponder data... maybe just
     another herkulex bus connector?

DONE 2015-06-28
 * Gave useful names to all ICs
 * do schematic ERC
 * line up all connectors
 * route 5V buck
 * make ground plane
 * try to line up other parts as best I can
 * decide on other power planes
   * 8V and 5V are the likely candidates
 * route weapon drive
 * route IMU
 * route power
 * first pass at silk sizing and placement before autoroute
 * label individual pins on headers
 * bottom chassis plate interferes with bottom USB connector on odroid
 * ensure connectors have sufficient clearance around top plate


DONE 2015-06-27
 * AVR crystal
 * Switch servo connectors to something SMT so that it doesn't eat
   up so much of both sides of the board
   * I guess JST XH
 * Switched fuse to SMT
 * Decided not to bother with 12V up converter for now.  If I build a
   custom gimbal board, I can put it on there.
 * Decided not to mess with custom gimbal controller.
 * IMU - MAX21000 + MMA8451Q
