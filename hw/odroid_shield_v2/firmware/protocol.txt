The device shares the serial bus with herculex, so the protocol
is fulley herculex compatible.

AVR listens at 115200 (divisor 16 in high-speed mode, 2.1% error)

It does not handle broadcasts because this it too much pain.

The device sits on address 99, and supports the following commands:
  CMD_STAT
  CMD_REBOOT -- does not reboot, just clears outputs and error flags.
  CMD_RAMWRITE/CMD_RAMREAD -- limited addresses
    - read address and status

    - read/write LEDS (53):
      GREEN is green LED pin (nothing is there yet)
      RED   is laser output
      BLUE  is blue LED on the board
      unlike real servo, if no LED commands are given for few
      seconds, all LEDs are turned off

    - read/write FIRE TIME (80, reserved)
      This is 1-byte register which can be read and written.
      As long as it is non-zero:
       - FIRE PWM may be non-zero
       - Value decreases by 1 every 10 mS

    - read/write FIRE PWM (81, reserved)
      This is 1-byte register which sets PWM value for fire motor.
      (0 = off, 255 = continious high)
      It is continously forced to zero unless FIRE CONTROL is set.

    - read/write AGITATOR PWM (82, reserved)
      This is 1-byte register which sets PWM value for agitator motor.
      (0 = off, 255 = continious high)
      It is bound to LED activity -- if LEDs are not updated for a while,
      then this value is forced to zero. Thus, you will want to write
      to LED register at the same time as to this register.

    - LEDS alias: (83, reserved) -- exactly the same as 53
      allows one-command access to agitator pwm
